Practice questions for Linked List and Recursion
Assume the structure of a Linked List node is as follows.

struct node
{
  int data;
  struct node *next;
};

Explain the functionality of following C functions.

1. What does the following function do for a given Linked List?

void fun1(struct node* head)
{
  if(head == NULL)
    return;
  
  fun1(head->next);
  printf("%d  ", head->data);
}

MY ANSWER: prints linked list on reverse order

2. What does the following function do for a given Linked List ?

void fun2(struct node* head)
{
  if(head== NULL)
    return;
  printf("%d  ", head->data); 
 
  if(head->next != NULL )
    fun2(head->next->next);
  printf("%d  ", head->data);   
}
MY ANSWER: prints every second element from current and then prints again them again but in reverse order.
