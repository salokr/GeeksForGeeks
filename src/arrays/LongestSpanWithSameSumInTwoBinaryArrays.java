Longest Span with same Sum in two Binary arrays
Given two binary arrays arr1[] and arr2[] of same size n. Find length of the longest common span (i, j) where j >= i such that arr1[i] + arr1[i+1] + …. + arr1[j] = arr2[i] + arr2[i+1] + …. + arr2[j].

Expected time complexity is Θ(n).

Examples:

Input: arr1[] = {0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0};
       arr2[] = {1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1};
Output: 4
The longest span with same sum is from index 1 to 4.

Input: arr1[] = {0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1};
       arr2[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1};
Output: 6
The longest span with same sum is from index 1 to 6.

Input: arr1[] = {0, 0, 0};
       arr2[] = {1, 1, 1};
Output: 0

Input: arr1[] = {0, 0, 1, 0};
       arr2[] = {1, 1, 1, 1};
Output: 1
