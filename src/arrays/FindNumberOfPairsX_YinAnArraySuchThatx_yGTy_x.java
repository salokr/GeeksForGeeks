Find number of pairs (x, y) in an array such that x^y > y^x
Given two arrays X[] and Y[] of positive integers, find number of pairs such that x^y > y^x where x is an element from X[] and y is an element from Y[].

Examples:

  Input: X[] = {2, 1, 6}, Y = {1, 5}
  Output: 3 
  // There are total 3 pairs where pow(x, y) is greater than pow(y, x)
  // Pairs are (2, 1), (2, 5) and (6, 1)


  Input: X[] = {10, 19, 18}, Y[] = {11, 15, 9};
  Output: 2
  // There are total 2 pairs where pow(x, y) is greater than pow(y, x)
  // Pairs are (10, 11) and (10, 15)
